# Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Business

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the sales performance of a retail business using SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI. It covers data extraction, transformation, visualization, and business insights generation.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Data extraction and manipulation
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and basic analysis
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: Advanced data processing and visualization
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and reports

## Steps to Execute

### Step 1: Data Extraction Using SQL
1. Connect to the database.
2. Extract sales data using SQL queries.
3. Export the result to CSV or Excel.

#### SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT order_id, customer_id, product_id, category, quantity, price, discount,
       (quantity * price) AS total_sales, order_date, region
FROM sales_data
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

### Step 2: Data Cleaning in Excel
1. Remove duplicate records.
2. Handle missing values.
3. Convert data types appropriately.
4. Save the cleaned file as a CSV.

### Step 3: Data Processing and Analysis Using Python
#### Load Data
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv('sales_data_cleaned.csv')
df.head()
```

#### Data Cleaning
```python
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
df.fillna({'discount': 0}, inplace=True)  # Fill missing discounts with 0
df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])
df.info()
```

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
```python
# Summary statistics
df.describe()

# Sales Trend Over Time
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.lineplot(x=df['order_date'], y=df['total_sales'])
plt.title('Sales Trend Over Time')
plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Power BI Visualization
1. Load the cleaned data into Power BI.
2. Create visuals such as:
   - Sales trends over months.
   - Top-selling products and categories.
   - Regional sales distribution.
3. Design an interactive dashboard.

## Expected Insights
- Identify peak sales months.
- Determine the most profitable products.
- Analyze regional performance.
- Understand the impact of discounts on sales.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to sales performance analysis, combining SQL for data extraction, Python for analysis, and Power BI for visualization. It helps in making data-driven business decisions.
